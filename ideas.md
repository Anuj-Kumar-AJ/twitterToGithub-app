# Inspiration of the PRoject

In todays time when there is very hype for learning in public , i.e share what you learn on social media . It is very important to store all the learning in the form of a repository. As tech is very vast it happens that what we learn today we don't use it actively and we forgot things, but Often time when we need that knowledge, We just think ` i learnt is but not getting it now` so its better to read what we learn on written on our own words then that of read docs online.

**It helps in two things**
    '''     
        1. It contain all our learning on a directory , and we can see through whenever we want in our language.
        2. Anyone can learn and contribute to this repository to increase the missing content and help new people to learn things
